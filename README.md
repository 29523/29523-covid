# Lab 1 - Active Rate of COVID-19 Cases in Canada

## Reflective Analysis
As we are approaching a year of lockdown due to Covid-19, I am curious if we are any closer to the end of a pandemic. In Vancouver, there is no designated date when the mini lockdown ends. However, I have been seeing plenty of people outside of their immediate family in public. I designed this map to see the current active rate of cases in each province, calculated per 100,000 population as of February 2021. By comparing the current rate of active cases in each province, we can deduce if British Columbia's health policies are effective or not and consider what other provinces may be doing differently. Using data collected by the Government of Canada (https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/?stat=rate&measure=active#a2), Ontario has around 15 million in the population, a rate of 71 compared to British Columbia’s higher rate of 92, with only a population of 5 million. 

I chose a basic map in Mapbox with a dark theme to match a “heavier” topic concerning a pandemic. It also contrasts nicely with the colour red, which gives off a sense of emergency and severity to the virus. I created a layer with the Canadian provinces as health care is under provincial jurisdiction. Overall, I saught of creating a simple choropleth map with an easily understandable legend. No high zoom functions into cities and city buildings are needed to clarify this map further. 

One important cartographic principle is visual contrast and colour representation. Everyone is familiar with the colour black. Therefore, I used a darker toned map background and a darker shade of red to indicate higher severity. Since I have eight classes, I have to be careful of which shades to use, so it is distinguishable to the human eye. One way to increase the readability of this map is by adding the number of active cases right onto each province rather than having it shown only when the mouse cursor moves on top. It would also be interesting to see this data compared to another country, such as the United States of America just below Canada.
